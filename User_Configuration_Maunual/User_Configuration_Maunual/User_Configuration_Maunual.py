Build a User Configuration Manager
In this lab, you will build a User Configuration Manager that allows users to manage their settings such as theme, language, and notifications. You will implement functions to add, update, delete, and view user settings.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should define a function named add_setting with two parameters representing a dictionary of settings and a tuple containing a key-value pair

add_setting function should:

Convert the key and value to lowercase.
If the key setting exists, return Setting '[key]' already exists! Cannot add a new setting with this name.
If the key setting doesn't exist, add the key-value pair to the given dictionary of settings and return Setting '[key]' added with value '[value]' successfully!.
The messages returned should have the key and value in lowercase.
You should define a function named update_setting with two parameters representing a dictionary of settings and a tuple containing a key-value pair.

update_setting function should:

Convert the key and value to lowercase.
If the key setting exists, update its value in the given dictionary of settings and return: Setting '[key]' updated to '[value]' successfully!
If the key setting doesn't exist, return Setting '[key]' does not exist! Cannot update a non-existing setting.
The messages returned should have the key and value in lowercase.
You should define a function named delete_setting with two parameters representing a dictionary of settings and a key.

delete_setting function should:

Convert the key passed to lowercase.
If the key setting exists, remove the key-value pair from the given dictionary of settings and return Setting '[key]' deleted successfully!
If the key setting does not exist, return Setting not found!
The messages returned should have the key in lowercase.
You should define a function named view_settings with one parameter representing a dictionary of settings.

view_settings function should:

Return No settings available. if the given dictionary of settings is empty.
If the dictionary contains any settings, return a string displaying the settings. The string should start with Current User Settings: followed by the key-value pairs, each on a new line and with the key capitalized. For example, view_settings({'theme': 'dark', 'notifications': 'enabled', 'volume': 'high'}) should return:
Current User Settings:
Theme: dark
Notifications: enabled
Volume: high

For testing the code, you should create a dictionary named test_settings to store some user configuration preferences.
